DISCOURSE ON SINGLE HERD  🐐  🐐  🐐  🐐  🐐  🐐

Constructs
	STAGE		: lifestages of an ibex, "m" indicates male, "f" indicates female, "sm" 
				  indicates the sexually mature stage, occuring at approximately 2 years 
				  old in females and 5 years old in male; "weaning" is the period in which 
				  the mother is supplying food to her young and so mother+kids are 
				  considered one functional until weaning is complete (5-8 months); "null" 
				  indicates empty/no ibex; different stages of life for the ibex are more
				  vulnerable to predation than others, which is represented in the 
				  herd_health function; the maturing function is a simplistic represenation
				  of the maturation progression for both males and females; my pregnancy 
				  period occurs for 2 months, but actual gestation 6 months, so the comb-
				  ination pregnant + weaning stage can last all the way for a year; the 
				  maximum lifespan of ibex in the wild is 15-17 years, however, I avoid
				  the problem of killing ibex due to old age (or I could introduce elderly
				  stage) by simply counting the number of sm adults, so any decrease can
				  be considered natural death due to age
				  progression (m): m_kid --> m_sm <--> m_rut
				  				   if death occurs, --> null
				  progression (f): f_kid --> f_sm <--> f_rut --> pregnant --> weaning -->
				  				   f_sm + m_kid + f_kid (this is the "birth" process)
				  				   if death occurs, --> null
	HEALTH		: health options for each demographic of ibex; I consider the whole 
				  demographic equally threatened by health concerns for practical reasons;
				  there are only three levels of health here, but more resolution could be
				  gained at the cost of increasing combinatorial complexity
	NUMBER		: maximum herd size, also used to indicate how many ibex are in a given
				  life stage, etc.
	CELL		: grid cells of landscape; landscape is divided into cells that are given
				  names used to track the level of resources available to an ibex herd in
				  each cell, as well as the location of a given herd or predator
	FLAG		: boolean variable (i.e. TRUE or FALSE), used to indicate presence of
				  danger from predator and the fertility status of the herd
	RESOURCES	: level of resources available for herd consumption (assigned to each 
				  location cell in an array); I have defined only three levels of resources
				  but more resolution could be gained at the cost of increasing 
				  combinatorial complexity
	MONTH		: months; used to track time, but any sufficiently small operational unit
				  can be used to track time
	HERDtuple	: the data structure (tuple) used to hold herd information; for herd A, 
				  the first tuple entry (A.1) is indexed by demographic information of herd
				  and thus gives how many ibex in the herd are in each lifestage; the 
				  second tuple entry (A.2) is indexed by demographic information again,
				  but holds the health of each demographic of the herd

Functions
	inc_h_down	: increments health down (healthy --> unhealthy --> dead <--> dead)
	inc_h_up	: increments health up (unhealthy --> healthy, dead <--> dead)
	inc_r_down	: increments resources down (high --> low --> zero)
	inc_r_up	: increments resources up (zero --> low --> high)
	aug_h		: calls inc_h_down when predator is present or ibex inhabits cell with 
				  zero resources; calls inc_h_up otherwise 
	inc_stage_h : defines which stages are most vulnerable to lack of food and predation;
				  non-empty stages become and unhealthy and then die in the following order:
				  weaning, pregnant, m_kid and f_kid, m_rut and f_rut, m_sm and f_sm (they 
				  recover health in the reverse order); the null stage is never passed into 
				  this function because it does not change state; the function orders the 
				  stages to be passed into aug_h based on the health of the prior stages 
				  in the order of incrementation
	health_fn	: guards empty stages, dead stages, and "null" from being passed into the
				  inc_stage_h function; assigns empty and dead stages to healthy, thus
				  reinitializing the stage
	mature		: ibex do not transition states unless it is Sept, Oct, Nov, Dec; in Sept, 
				  sexually mature ibex mature to rutting ibex; in Oct, when the herd is 
				  fertile, rutting feamles mature to pregnant; in Nov, pregnant ibex mature
				  to weaning ibex; in Dec, kids mature to sexually mature, weaning ibex are
				  returned to sexually females, and their babies (1 male, 1 female each) 
				  mature to kids, remaining pregnant or rutting ibex are returned to 
				  sexually mature 
	tabulate	: ibex do not transition states unless it is Sept, Oct, Nov, Dec; in Sept,
				  rutting ibex are returned to the sexually mature stages; in Oct, rutting 
				  ibex are returned to the sexually mature stages and pregnant ibex do not
				  survive; in Nov, rutting and weaning ibex are returned to the sexually 
				  mature stages and pregnant ibex do not survive; in Dec, kids do not 
				  mature to sexually mature stages, babies die during weaning and are not
				  added to the kid tabulations, rutting and weaning ibex are returned to 
				  the sexually mature stages and pregnant ibex do not survive
	stage_fn	: guards which stages are pushed into mature and tabulate functions; dead 
				  stages are emptied (number of ibex in the stage is set to 0); null (the 
				  number of uninitialized ibex spots in the herd) is recalculated, note 
				  that dead ibex hold a spot for one step (one month) and are not considered
				  uninitialized; if a stage is unhealthy or about to be (zero resources or 
				  a predator is present) then the stage will not transition according to 
				  the mature function, and needs to be able to accomodate a healthy cohort
				  entering into an unhealthy cohort (or vice versa), so the stages are 
				  passed into the tabulate function; otherwise the stages are passed into
				  the mature function				    
	clock		: increments time by months (Jan --> Feb --> March --> ... --> Dec --> Jan)
	fertility	: determines if offspring can be produced during seasonal rut (at least 
				  one healthy male and one healthy female are required to attempt a mating); 
				  TRUE if mating is possible, else FALSE
	dangerous	: determines if herd is threatened by predator; if predator occupies same
				  cell of territory as herd does; TRUE if herd is threatened, else FALSE
	
Variables & Definitions
	f: boolean variable indicates fertility of herd; TRUE is fertile; calculated by the 
	   function fertility
	danger: boolean variable indicates if the herd occupies the same cell as a predator and
			is thus in danger; TRUE is in danger; calculated by the function dangerous
	p : a cell variable; indicates location of predator to the herd; p is randomly set to 
		be in c6, c8, or c9 at each step
	c : a cell variable; indicates location of herd
	m : a month variable; indicates current month
	A : a HERDtuple construct; holds numbers and health of herd stages
	r : an array construct; holds the resource level of each cell in the environment
	
Transitions 
	Transitions are governed by herd location to minimize combinatorial complexity. At each 
step, the resources of the landscape cells adjust (down as the herd consumes resources in 
its current cell; up as resources recover in cells without herds), time proceeds (a month 
passes per step in the simulation), the ibex decide where in the landscape to move next 
(either moving to an adjacent landscape cell or staying in the current cell), and the herd 
health and stage numbers adjust based on the month, predator danger, and resource levels 
of the landscape. There is one additional guard, which stabilizes an extinct herd so that 
it no longer "travels," i.e. a completely uninitialized herd no longer moves around.
